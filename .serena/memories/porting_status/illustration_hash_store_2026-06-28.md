# 2026-06-28: illustration hash store

- Follow-up to `mem:porting_status/illustration_dedup_web_state_2026-06-28`.
- Added `src/illustration_store.rs` as the shared persistent illustration mapping layer. It stores `.illustration_cache.yaml` in each novel archive directory, outside `挿絵/`, with mappings for normalized source URL, mitemin image ID, and SHA-256 content hash.
- Remote mitemin illustration files keep Ruby-compatible ID filenames such as `挿絵/i422674.jpg`; `.illustration_cache.yaml` stores the mitemin ID to hash mapping. Non-mitemin remote sources are stored as `挿絵/<sha256>.<ext>` so identical byte content deduplicates by hash after download.
- Existing legacy files such as `挿絵/i422674.jpg` are reused directly for mitemin compatibility. Non-mitemin legacy URL-basename files are read, hashed, and copied to the hash filename when encountered; the legacy file is not deleted automatically.
- `IllustrationStore::load` now runs a best-effort mitemin filename migration. It uses existing `.illustration_cache.yaml` source mappings and `raw/*.html` `<img src>` order to rename old hash filenames or `section-index-count` filenames such as `16-0.jpg` to Ruby-compatible `iNNNN.<ext>`. If the target ID file already exists with the same hash, the duplicate legacy file is removed.
- `src/converter/mod.rs` uses the store for HTML `<img>` localization and bumped the section conversion context marker to `illustration-localization:v4`.
- `src/downloader/mod.rs::download_illustration` also uses the same store for `illust_grep_pattern` prefetches.
- Verification: `cargo test illustration_store --lib`, `cargo test localize_section --lib`, `cargo test convert_novel_keeps_localized_illustration_annotation --lib`, and `cargo check` passed.
